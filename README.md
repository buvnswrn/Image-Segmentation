# Vision-Project-Image-Segmentation
Welcome to the Vision-Project-Image-Segmentation Repository !

This is the final project for a course at Saarland University called Neural Networks: Theory and Implementation (NNTI). The project is an introduction to the Object Segmentation task. In this project, we need to implement different neural methods used in Object segmentation. We are expected to make use of concepts that we have learned in the lecture. The project is divided into three tasks, the details of which you can find in the next pages.

The project contains three tasks. All the implementations are done using PyTorch Library.

Below is the overview of the tasks. For more details, consider referring the wiki page and the report. 
#### **Task1:** It is an introduction to Object segmentation task. We are provided with a half complete notebook where we are required to complete the segmentation task on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset by choosing our own architecture. To see the implementation consider refering and running *'Vision_task_1.ipynb'* file.


#### **Task2:** In this task we are given a [reference paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1802/1802.06955.pdf) and are required to reproduce the architecture and apply it on the [Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) . To reproduce our results, make sure the dataset is downloaded to *'/datasets'* folder and then try running *'Task 2.ipynb'* file.


#### **Task3:** In this challenge task, we are required to possibly improvise our results that is obtained from Task 2. For this, we have used new architecture by combining 'Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling' and 'Attention Gates' with the above R2U-Net. We call this architecture as ASPP R2U-Net with Attention Gates. To reproduce our results, run the *'Task 3.ipynb'* file.
